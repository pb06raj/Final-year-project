				<h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">UK traditions and culture</h2>
				
                <p>The UK is rich with culture and customs, from historic castles and buildings to beautiful gardens. We've written a short guide for international students in the UK.</p>
                
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark"> Food and drink</h3>
                <p>Most known for our love of tea, scones and fish and chips in the UK there are a number of food and drink items you should sample while in the UK. These can be found at various markets, shops, cafes and restaurants. Your institution may also be able to recommend the best, affordable places to eat in your area. Read more at <a href="https://study-uk.britishcouncil.org/">Education UK.</a></p>
                
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark"> From the traditional to the weird and wonderful</h3>
                <p>There are some cultural experiences in the UK which may seem a little unusual when you first get here. From rolling a cheese down a hill to weaving ribbons around a pole, there are a lot of curious customs here in the UK. To find activities near you or to read more about them visit <a href="http://www.cntraveller.com/recommended/uk/strange-customs-english-traditions-weird-events">Conde Nast Traveller.</a></p>
                
                 <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Unspoken rules and etiquette</h3>
                <p>As with every culture, in the UK there are a number of unspoken rules that are often expected to be adhered to. Don’t worry about it too much – you’ll soon pick them up. Most notable are;  punctuality - if you’re due to meet someone but are running more than five minutes late then you should let them know if possible, queuing (which we’re famous for!) and making small talk when first introduced to someone.</p>
                <p>Read more at <a href="http://www.educationuk.org/global/articles/uk-etiquette/">Education UK</a> or <a href="http://www.educationuk.org/global/articles/student-tips-etiquette/">read some tips from international students themselves.</a></p>

                 <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Students’ Union (DSU)</h3>

                <h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">Festivals and celebrations</h2>
                <p>Make the most of your time in the UK by experiencing some of our festivals and celebrations. We host a number of multicultural festivals. Highlights include:</p>
                
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Chinese New Year</h4>
                <p>Outside Asia, the world’s biggest celebration of Chinese New Year is in London – each year there is a parade through Chinatown in the West End. DMU holds a big celebration during chinese new year and everyone gets invited to be a part of the celebration. Get in touch with your Students’ Union.</p>
                
                
                 <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Bonfire night</h4>
                <p>Historically, this marks the anniversary of Guy Fawkes’ plot to blow up the House of Lords and assassinate King James I in 1605 – the failed 'gunpowder plot' is remembered in the children’s rhyme ‘Remember, remember the 5th of November; gunpowder, treason and plot’. Today, it is commemorated with spectacular displays of fireworks.</p>

                <p>There will be firework displays in most cities, but one of the best places to be is in the medieval town of Lewes, East Sussex where you’ll witness a procession, colourful costumes and the traditional ‘guy’, an effigy made of straw or paper to burn on the bonfire.</p>

                <p>You will get notifications on your DMU email when bonfire night will be celebrarted in Leicester.</p>
                
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Christmas</h4>
                <p>Most people in the UK celebrate Christmas, even if they are not religious. There will be Christmas trees, presents, carol singing, mulled wine (warm, spiced red wine), mince pies (small pies with a sweet fruit filling) and if it snows, snowmen and snowball fights! The traditional Christmas dinner is a whole roast turkey with roast potatoes, vegetables, gravy and Christmas pudding for dessert (a steamed sponge pudding with dried fruit) – but each family has its own variations.
