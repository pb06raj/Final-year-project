				<h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">Tier 4 students - work right.</h2>
				
				<p>The Home Office permits Tier 4 students to work during their studies but state in the Tier 4 Policy Guidance:</p>
				
				<p>" The main purpose of the Tier 4 visa route is for you to come to the UK to study. Where you are permitted to work, the intention is that this should be to supplement your income whilst studying (which in most cases we expect this to be taking a part-time role for an established business/organisation)..or as part of a work placement provided it is an intergral and assessed part of your course."</p>
				
				<p>Under the UK immigration rules, you are legally permitted to work with the following restrictions:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a maximum of 20 hours paid or unpaid work per week during term time for degree students
</li>
                    <li>a maximum of 10 hours paid or unpaid work per week during term time for Language Centre students</li>
                    <li>full time work is permitted during vacations </li>
                    <li>you cannot take a permanent contract (open ended) until you have submitted an application for a work permit e.g. Tier 2 </li>
                    <li>no self-employment (including  freelance or consultancy work or setting up your own business, even if you are not the controlling shareholder)</li>
                    <li>no work as a professional sports person (including sports coach) or entertainer.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Check your BRP  to make sure that you have been given the correct working conditions. If you think the Home Office has made a mistake (for example your BRP says work prohibited), you may be able to get this amended. </p>
                <h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">Can I do a work placement as part of my programme?</h2>
                <p>The Tier 4 rules only allow you to undertake a full-time work placement if it is an "integral and assessed" part of the programme and does not exceed 33% of the structure.  However, this does not mean that you can arrange you own internship and ask your department to assess it for you.  </p>
                
                <p>Work placements need to be an approved component of your programme and included in the School's regulations.  Only three 12 month Masters degrees at LSE have an approved work placement as part of the programme. </p>
                
                 <h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">What happens if I break the rules?</h2>
                <p>If you work when you do not have permission to do so or you take employment that is not covered by the rules, you are committing an immigration offence. If found, you could be:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>taken to court;</li>
                    <li>fined up to Â£5,000;</li>
                    <li>be sent to prison for up to six months; </li>
                    <li>liable to be removed (deported). </li>
                    <li>banned from returning to the UK from between one to ten years and would have to declare this ban and your illegal working on future immigration applications to the UK and other countries</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You should consider the long term implications working illegally may have on your future before taking the risk.

The Home Office requires Tier 4 sponsors to report breaches of conditions, such as illegal working.  If the LSE becomes aware that you are working illegally, we will be required to report you to the Home Office, which could put our sponsor licence at risk </p>
