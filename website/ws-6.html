				<h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">Driving in the UK</h2>
				
				<p>Before driving any vehicle (car, motorbike, van etc) in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), you should check that you meet all of the legal requirements which apply (a) to the driver and (b) to the vehicle; and that you are aware of the correct procedures, which may be very different from your home country.</p>
				
				<p>It is a criminal offence to drive using a licence that is not valid in the UK. In addition, if you do so, your car insurance will be invalidated and you will be committing a further criminal offence of 'driving without motor insurance'.</p>
				<p>If you hold a driving licence issued outside of Great Britain (that is England, Scotland and Wales) then you can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-nongb-licence">tool on the Government website</a> to check whether you can use it to drive in the UK.  You may be allowed to do so for a limited period of time only.</p>
                
              <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Immigration issues</h3>  
                <p>Since 14 July 2014 applicants for a UK driving licence are required to show that they have immigration permission to be in the UK for at least six months, unless they have a driving licence from an EEA or other designated country.  The designated countries are as follows:</p>
                 <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">For driving in England, Scotland and Wales:</h4> 
                <p>Andorra, Australia, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Canada*, Falkland Islands, Faroe Islands*, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Republic of Korea*, Singapore, South Africa**, Switzerland and Zimbabwe.</p>
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">For driving in Northern Ireland:</h4> 
                <p>Australia, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Provinces & Territories of Canada*, Falkland Islands, Faroe Islands*, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Republic of Korea*, Singapore, South Africa**, Switzerland and Zimbabwe.</p>
                
                <p>*Some restrictions on what you can drive apply</p>
                <p>**Format of licence is relevant</p>
                
                <p>If you cease to be lawfully resident in the UK, for example if you become an overstayer, the DVLA can revoke your driving licence.</p>
                <p>If you are making an immigration application for permission to come to or remain in the UK, you are required to declare criminal convictions. Please note that road traffic offences must be declared and can be treated very seriously. If you have been disqualified from driving then you will need to declare this.</p>
                <p>Although you are not required to declare any fixed penalty notices (which were not issued by a court), be aware that if you fail to pay, this could result in a more serious punishment, which may have to be declared. If you have received multiple fixed penalty notices then this could also be treated seriously by the Home Office when considering your immigration application. You are advised to seek legal advice from an immigration specialist if you think any of these matters may affect you.</p>
