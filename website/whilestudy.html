                <p></p>
				
				<p>With diverse landscapes, a vibrant cultural offer and the chance to make friends from all over the world, time spent in the UK will be life-changing. Find out what it’s like to live and study in the UK and get ready to enjoy the experience.</p>
				
				<p>The UK offers an amazing student life that can be tailored to suit your own tastes. You’ll find an endless number of ways to enjoy yourself, learn new things and make friends.</p>

<p>At the beginning of term universities hold a ‘Welcome Week’, often called ‘Freshers’ Week’, to welcome new students. During this time university clubs and societies hold events and parties to look for new members. It’s a great way to find out what's on and join anything that interests you.</p>

<p>Most universities have a huge selection of clubs and societies, so there are activities to suit everyone. Whether you want to discuss politics, learn how to bake, join a band or go scuba diving, you’re sure to find something that appeals.</p>

<p>As well as meeting like-minded people and having loads of fun, joining clubs and societies can be a great way to gain experience and add more soft skills to your CV. Many societies offer opportunities to organise events, raise money for charity or do some volunteering, all of which are sure to stand you in good stead when you start applying for jobs.</p>
                
                <h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">DMU</h2>
