                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Study methods</h3>
				
				<p>This section is intended to give you an introduction to the different teaching and assessment methods used in UK institutions (colleges and universities). It also gives some information about                                 expectations and attitudes to study in the UK.</p>
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Lectures</h4>
                <p>These are large classes, usually lasting around one hour, where a lecturer (or tutor) talks about a subject and the students take notes. On some courses there can be over a hundred students in a lecture. There is usually little or no opportunity to ask questions during the lecture.</p>
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Seminars</h4>
                <p>These are smaller classes where students and a tutor discuss a topic. Seminars often last longer than lectures. You will know in advance what the topic is, and the tutor will usually ask some students to prepare a short presentation for discussion. Seminars are usually intended to encourage debate about an issue. Both the tutor and students can express their opinions and may even disagree on certain points. This type of debate is actively encouraged. The aim is not for students to be told the "correct" answer, but to understand the different arguments and make judgements about their merits. This process helps you learn to analyse a topic critically.</p>
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Lab sessions</h4>
                <p>On many courses you will have practical workshops, for example, laboratories on science courses, performance classes in music or drama, a mock trial on a law course. On some courses (for example, geography) you may go on field trips away from the institution. You may work individually but more usually you will be part of a group. Practical classes are usually intended to give you practical experience of the theories you learn in other classes and to develop practical skills.</p>
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Workplace training</h4>
                <p>On some courses you will have training in a working environment, under the supervision of experienced staff (for example, working in a hospital on a nursing or medicine course). Other courses offer "sandwich" placements - an opportunity to spend time away from classes working in employment related to your course of study.</p>
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Seeking help</h4>
                <p>Lecturers and tutors will normally be available to provide help and advice on a very limited basis outside timetabled classes. You should try to ask your questions during tutorials or if the lecturer invites questions in lectures or seminars, use that time. You may be able to see staff during their "office hour", a designated time during the week when they are available to see students. Outside these times staff are likely to be very busy.</p>
                
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Assessment methods</h3>
				
				<p>You will normally be asked to produce written work regularly throughout your period of study. This work is often assessed. This may be to monitor your progress and help you identify areas for improvement or it may contribute to your overall mark or grade for the course. This section explains some of the most common forms of assessment.</p>
				
                <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Written work</h4>
				<p>You will almost certainly be asked to produce written work, usually through independent study. Written work may include:

                    <ul><li>essays</li>
                   <li> a project or a dissertation (a long essay based on extensive independent research, data collection or experimentation)</li>
                   <li> assignment questions (for example, a series of mathematical problems)</li></ul>
                </p>
            <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Other projects and assignments</h4>
            <p>On some courses you may also be asked to produce work in other forms. For example, you may be asked to write a laboratory report, computer programme, prepare a poster presentation about a topic, or prepare practical work for evaluation. This could be an individual work or a group work.</p>
            <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Examinations</h4>
            <p>UK institutions use many different forms of assessment, including:</p>
                <ul><li>"closed" examinations, where you are not allowed to refer to books or notes and have a specific time to complete a certain number of questions</li>
                    <li>"open" examinations, where you can refer to books and notes and may even be able to take the question paper away and return it by a certain time</li>
                 
            </ul>
            
            <h4 class="titlefont  title-size-1 bluedark">Plagiarism</h4>
            <p>Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as your own. If you present the words or ideas of an author or another student without acknowledging the source, you could be accused of plagiarism. Whenever you use a quotation from a book, or reproduce an author’s ideas (even in your own words), you should indicate the source. This process is known as referencing. You may find the accepted ways of quoting and referencing work in the UK are different from those you are used to. Penalties for plagiarism, especially in assessed work and examinations, can be very severe, and may include failing the course. Most academic departments have a preferred style of referencing. Check with your tutor about how you should reference your work: don’t rely on the advice of other students/friends.</p>
