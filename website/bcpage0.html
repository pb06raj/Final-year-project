                <p>
            <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Sources of information</h3>
                
                <p>The internet is a good place to obtain information about an institution and the courses it runs. For example, you can search for courses on the British Council's Education UK website and De Montfort University website.</p>

                <p>You can look for and apply for courses using the UCAS website.</p>

                <p>The Steps to Postgraduate Study website is a new resource which helps you think about the right questions to ask when searching for a postgraduate course. You can also search for postgraduate research and study opportunities on DMU website</p>

               <p> DMU website has details of all courses, or you can ask us to send you the prospectus, a free booklet which provides information about the university and the courses. Many British Council offices have copies of this prospectuses, and the British Council also produces a range of Education Information Notes about studying in the UK.</p>
                
            <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Choosing a college or university- General information</h3>
                
                <p>There are many factors that need to be taken into account when choosing a course. Things such as the cost of the tuition fees and living expenses, the city where the university is located, the course curriculum and the university ranking  are the most likely to influence a decision. The QS World University Rankings website provides a good starting point in assessing prospective universities through a variety of filters such as country, subject, reputation, faculty and others. These are particularly useful as there are cases when, even if a university has a high overall ranking, its performance ranking for the course of interest might be lower than that.<p/>

                <p>You may also find the Times Higher Education useful. Each year they provide a ranking of 'most international universities in the world' and publish it on their website.</p>

                <p>Other useful sources to check include the UCAS website, which includes useful advice and tips on choosing a course. Also, for more general information on how to find a course or to read more about how it is like studying in Britain, have a look at the Association of Collegesâ€™ website. </p>

                <p>UK immigration permission (a student visa) is granted only for study at colleges and universities which are listed on the Register of Tier 4 Sponsors.</p>

                <p>Check the college or university website to find out what their policy is on refunding deposits and fees to you in the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><a>your immigration application is refused</a></li>
                    <li><a>the college closes</a></li>
                    <li><a>the college loses its Tier 4 Sponsor Licence</a></li>
                    <li><a> your course doesn't run</a></li>
                </ul>
              
                
                
               <p>Also check on the website that they have a policy for handling complaints. Do not pay any money until you are clear what their policies are on refunds, and handling complaints.</p>

                <p>Print the policies out in case you need to refer to them later. You should ask the college or university to send you written copies if you cannot find the policies on their website.</p>
                
        <h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">Degrees</h2>
                <p>The UK government releases an official list at regular intervals which contains a list of institutions that can award recognised UK degrees. You can visit that website and check for affiliation of De Montfort University. Howerver, all the information is given in our website and in this international students website.</p>
    
            <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">How to apply?</h3>
                <p>For undergraduate degree level courses at UK publicly-funded institutions, you should apply through the central admissions system called the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). The UCAS website has information specifically for international students and you can apply online.</p>

                <p>However, DMU also accept direct applications to undergraduate degree courses: check with the International admissions office.</p>

                <p>For other courses, for example Postgraduate courses or English Language courses, check the prospectus for the correct way to apply and any application deadlines.</p>


            <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Your qualifications</h3>
                <p>You can check the equivalence of your country's qualifications with those in the UK by contacting the National Recognition Information Centre for the UK (UK NARIC). The international recruitment staff at the institution where you want to study may also be able to advise you.</p>
                
            <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Tuition fees</h3>
                <p>The Complete information about our couse fees is given in the prospectus or in the fees and money section of this website.</p>
