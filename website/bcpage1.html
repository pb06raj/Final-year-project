                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Student immigration: the basics</h3>
				
                <p>Most types of immigration permission allow you to study in the UK.</p>

                   <p> The categories aimed specifically at students are Tier 4 (of the Points-Based System) and the short-term student route.</p>

                <p>DMU provides you information about:</p>
                
                
                    <ul>
                    <li>the Tier 4 (General) student route for students aged 16 and older</li>
                   <li> the short-term student route for students who want to study courses that are up to 6 months long or English language courses up to 11 months long</li>
                  <li>	how to deal with immigration problems, including what to do if you lose your passport or biometric residence permit or if your education provider closes. </li>
                        </ul> 
                
                
                
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Tier 4: eligibility and requirements</h3>
                    
				<p>Tier 4 (General) visas are issued for certain full-time courses.  If your course is eligible course then your institution will give you a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) with which you can apply for a Tier 4 visa.</p>

                <p>You need to meet a number of requirements, and submit appropriate evidence of this, in order to be granted a Tier 4 visa. </p>

                <p>There are limits on how much time you can spend in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) student. </p>

                <p>This information is based on the changes to the Immigration Rules which come into force on 6 April 2017. The Home Office's Tier 4 policy guidance was last updated in November 2016. We update our information as soon as possible after any changes. However, if you have printed this webpage, we advise that you check on our website that it is still the most recent version</p>
				
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Time limits on study in the UK</h3>
                    
				<p>There are maximum time limits ('caps') on studying with a Tier 4 visa. Before they can issue you a confirmation of acceptance for studies, a Tier 4 sponsor will need to check that your application will not take you over the maximum time allowed. The Home Office will not grant further leave to someone whose current Tier 4 application means they will exceed these time limits unless there are "compelling and compassionate circumstances", such as injury or disability. </p>

                <p>When making these calculations the Home Office will count the time in months and will round individual days upwards or downwards to the nearest month. For example, three months and ten days will be rounded down to three months but three months and three weeks will be rounded up to four months. </p>

                <p>The Immigration Rules make it clear that it is the period of leave that you have previously been granted that will count towards the time limits, even if you did not spend all of this time studying and/or you used this time to study a different level of course. This includes the extra periods of time added to your visa before and after your course. </p>

                <p>However, the Home Office's Tier 4 policy guidance states that if your leave has been curtailed, the date that your curtailed leave expired will be used.</p>
                
				<p>If you are a Syrian national who is normally resident in Syria, but who is currently resident in the UK then these time limits will not apply to you, you should check the concession for Syrian nationals before applying.  If you need to rely on this concession we suggest that you speak to an immigration adviser before you apply and that you include a letter with your application explaining your situation and asking for the concession to be applied.</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Below degree level: 2 Years</li>
                <li>Degree level: 5 Years</li>
                </ul>

                <p></p>
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)</h3>
            
                    <p>You must have a CAS before making an application as a Tier 4 (General) student. A CAS is an electronic document issued to you by the institution (college, school or university) that you have chosen to study at. Your CAS will be valid for use in a Tier 4 application for six months from the date that it was generated by your institution. </p>
                
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Your Money</h3>
            
                <p>You will need enough money to pay for your course fees and your living costs while you are in the UK. The Home Office refers to this as the maintenance requirements.</p>

                    <p>Maintenance must be in the form of cash funds. You cannot use evidence of other types of finances, such as shares, bonds or a pension fund. You also cannot use an overdraft facility. </p>
                
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">Evidence</h3>
                  <p> Your application must include a valid passport and all the documents listed in the application forms and guidance. Unlike many other countries the UK doesn't require that a passport is valid for any particular period of time after arrival in the UK; but it must be valid when you make your application and when you arrive in the UK.  It must also contain at least one full page that is blank on both sides.</p>

                <p>If your passport will expire shortly after you arrive in the UK then it is advisable to renew it before you apply for your Tier 4 visa, if there is time to do so.  If your passport will expire at any other point during your time in the UK then you should check if you will be able to replace it in the UK as this is not possible for all nationalities.  </p>

                <p>We advise that you copy all of your documents and print out your application form before you send your documents.  You should keep these copies for your records in case there are any problems with your application.</p>

                <p>P.S- Some countries may have specific evendential requirements.</p>
