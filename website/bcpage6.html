				<h2 class="titlefont  title-size-2 bluedark">Culture shock</h2>
				
				<p>While usually temporary, culture shock is common among international students arriving in the UK. You will notice differences between the way things are done and what you are used to at home. These include the way people dress, speak and behave, teaching and learning styles, food - potentially all aspects of life.</p>

<p>This can be frustrating and disorienting at first, as even something simple like buying a bus ticket needs figuring out - can I buy it on the bus, or from a shop or kiosk? Do I have to validate it? Does it cover a single trip, or a set period of time?</p>

<p>You will soon learn the new "rules" to get by, but it may be reassuring to know that it's perfectly normal to find it hard at first. Your fellow international students will share the experience - but so will many UK students who are away from home for the first time.</p>
                
                <h3 class="titlefont  title-size-1-5 bluedark">How to help yourself?</h3>
                <p>Though culture shock is normally a temporary phase, it is important to know there are things you can do to help so that some of these worrying effects can be minimised. Don’t feel “this isn’t going to happen to me”. Culture shock can hit you whatever culture you come from and however experienced or well-travelled you are.</p>
         <p>     
            <ul>
                <li>Simply understanding that this is a normal experience may in itself be helpful.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Keeping in touch with home is an important part of living in a different country. The internet makes it very easy to maintain regular contact, for example by using web-based chat or voice calls, or by sharing news, information and photos of your life in the UK through online social networks. However, maintaining very regular (perhaps daily) contact with home, especially when you first arrive, or if you are finding aspects of life in the UK challenging, can actually make the process of settling in more difficult. Try to balance maintaining contact with home with taking time to get to know your new environment. Similarly, if you live close enough to travel home at weekends, it is a good idea not to go home too often. Once or twice a term is probably best. Newspapers and satellite TV will also be an option for some people, again, see what is available for international students in your college or university.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Have familiar things around you that have personal meaning, such as photographs or ornaments.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Find a supplier of familiar food if you can. Your student adviser or a student society may be able to help.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Eat a healthy and balanced diet.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Take regular exercise. As well as being good for your health it can be a way of meeting people.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Make friends with international students, whether from your own culture or from others, as they will understand what you’re feeling and, if possible, make friends with the local students so you can learn more about each other’s culture.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Be prepared to take the first step and find activities which will give you a common interest with UK students eg sports, music or volunteering.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Take advantage of all the help that is offered by your institution. In particular, the orientation programme offered by most colleges and universities can be a valuable way of meeting people and finding out about things that can help you.  Use the university or college services, where there will be professional and experienced staff. For example the health service, the counselling service, the International Office or hall wardens will provide a friendly, listening ear. Even if at home you wouldn’t consider such steps, in the UK it is quite normal and they may help when your familiar helpers are missing. If you are finding settling down difficult, your personal tutor probably also needs to know. She or he may be able to help, particularly with adjusting to a different academic system.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>For some students linking with a faith community will put you in touch with a familiar setting, whether it is a church, mosque, synagogue or temple. Many universities have a chaplaincy in which several faiths may be represented. There may also be religious student societies. Many chaplaincies welcome students of all faiths for pastoral or social activities.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Investigate the Students’ Union and its societies. There may be an opportunity to learn a new sport or activity or continue an interest from home. A further advantage is that these societies bring together students from different courses and countries with a shared interest. There are often national societies that will celebrate significant occasions such as Chinese New Year or Thanksgiving. For UK students, student societies can be one of the many ways of making new friends.</li>   <p></p>
                <li>Above all find some one to talk to who will listen uncritically and with understanding, rather than isolating yourself.</li>   <p></p>
                <p></p>
            <p>Finally.....</p>
                <p>It is important to stress that culture shock is entirely normal, usually unavoidable and not a sign that you have made a mistake or that you won’t manage. In fact there are very positive aspects of culture shock. The experience can be a significant learning experience, making you more aware of aspects of your own culture as well as the new culture you have entered. It will give you valuable skills that will serve you in many ways now and in the future and which will be part of the benefit of an international education.</p>
